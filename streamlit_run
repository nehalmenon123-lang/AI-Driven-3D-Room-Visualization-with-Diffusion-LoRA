## üîç System Architecture
As detailed in the poster:
1. **Input Acquisition**: NLP for text, OpenCV for sketches, CNN for mood boards.
2. **Diffusion Generation**: Pretrained model synthesizes initial 3D layout via denoising.
3. **LoRA Customization**: User-driven mods (e.g., furniture repositioning) with low params.
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Feedback loop for progressive enhancements.
5. **Rendering & Export**: Photorealistic outputs with Three.js integration.

## üìä Results & Evaluation
- **Quantitative**:
  | Metric                  | Score/Value       |
  |-------------------------|-------------------|
  | Design Quality Rating   | 9.2/10            |
  | Customization Accuracy  | 96%               |
  | Generation Time         | ~10 seconds       |
  | Refinement Time         | <5 seconds        |

- **Qualitative**: Users loved the intuitive flow and realism. See `figures/performance_metrics.png` for plots.

- **Comparisons**: Outperforms static AR/VR tools (e.g., from literature) in speed and flexibility.

## üî¨ Research Foundation
**Literature Review** (Top 10 from DOCX):
| S.No | Reference | Focus | Key Contribution |
|------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| 1    | Patel & Mandekar (2024) | AR in Interior Design | Enhances client engagement via real-time viz. |
| 2    | Dunston et al. (2011) | VR Mock-Ups | Improves collaboration in design reviews. |

**Research Gaps Addressed**: Multimodal inputs, real-time processing, LoRA for fine-tuning‚Äîfilling voids in static tools.

**Objectives Achieved**: As per PPTX‚Äîdeveloped tool, multimodal support, real-time refinement, high-quality outputs.

## üå± Future Scope
- VR/AR Integration: Immerse in generated rooms.
- Voice/Gesture Inputs: Hands-free design.
- Collaborative Mode: Real-time multi-user editing.
- Edge AI: Mobile app for on-the-go visualization.
- Bias Audits: Ensure diverse, inclusive designs.
